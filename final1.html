            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>Our tourism report looks at how many people from India went to other countries between 2014 and 2020. What we found is that more and more Indians have been traveling abroad during these years. There are a few reasons for this. One is that more people in India have money to spend on travel. Another reason is that it's become easier to go to other countries because of better flights and travel options. People also want to have new and different experiences when they travel.

                We noticed a big increase in the number of Indian travelers going abroad after 2017. This shows that more Indians are interested in seeing the world beyond their own country. By looking at where people went and when they went, we can see which places were most popular and when people liked to travel the most.
                
                It's important to think about things like the economy, politics, and health when we talk about tourism. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, travel slowed down a lot because of safety concerns. Understanding how these things affect travel helps us plan better for the future and make sure people can keep enjoying traveling in a safe and sustainable way.</p>

            <h2>Tools Used in Project: HTML, CSS, and IBM Cognos</h2>
            <p><h3>Introduction:</h3>
            For our project, we utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and IBM Cognos for creating a comprehensive and visually appealing solution. Each tool played a crucial role in different aspects of the project, contributing to its success in various ways.

            <h3>HTML and CSS:</h3>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) formed the backbone of our project's frontend development. HTML provided the structure and content of our web pages, while CSS was used for styling and presentation. Together, they allowed us to create a user-friendly and responsive interface that enhanced the overall user experience.

            With HTML, we organized our content into meaningful sections, ensuring clarity and readability for users interacting with our project. CSS then allowed us to customize the visual appearance of these elements, including colors, fonts, layouts, and animations. By leveraging the power of CSS, we were able to create a visually appealing design that aligned with our project's objectives and branding guidelines.

           <h3> IBM Cognos:</h3>
            IBM Cognos served as our primary tool for data visualization and analytics. With its robust features and capabilities, IBM Cognos enabled us to transform raw data into actionable insights and compelling visualizations. We leveraged its intuitive interface to create interactive dashboards, reports, and charts that provided stakeholders with valuable information and decision-making support.

            One of the key advantages of using IBM Cognos was its ability to handle large datasets and perform advanced analytics, allowing us to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations within our data. Additionally, its scalability and integration capabilities ensured seamless collaboration and data sharing across our project team.</p>
